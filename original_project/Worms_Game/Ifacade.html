	Implement this interface to connect your code to the user interface.

  <ul>
  <li>For separating the code that you wrote from the code that was provided to you,
  put <b>your code in the <code>src</code> folder.</b>
  The code that is provided to you stays in the <code>src-provided</code> folder.
  If you modify the provided code, it's advised to move the modified code to the <code>src</code> folder as well,
  so that your changes are not accidentally overwritten by an update.
  </li>
  
  <li>You should at least add the following classes to the package <code>worms.model</code>:
  <ul>
  <li>a class <code>World</code> for representing the world</li>
  <li>a class <code>Worm</code> for representing a worm</li>
  <li>a class <code>Food</code> for representing a food ration</li>
  <li>a class <code>Projectile</code> for representing a projectile</li>
  <li>a class <code>Program</code> for representing a program</li>
  <li>a class <code>Facade</code> that implements this interface (<code>IFacade</code>).</li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>
   The header of that Facade class should look as follows:<br>
  <code>class Facade implements IFacade { ... }</code><br>
   Consult the <a href=
  "http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html">
  Java tutorial</a> for more information on interfaces, if necessary.
  </li>
  
  <li>Each method defined in the interface <code>IFacade</code> must be
  implemented by the class <code>Facade</code>. For example, the implementation
  of <code>getX</code> should call a method of the given <code>worm</code> to
  retrieve its x-coordinate.</li>
  
  <li>Methods in this interface are allowed to throw only
  <code>ModelException</code>. No other exception types are allowed. This
  exception can be thrown only if calling a method of your <code>Worm</code>
  class with the given parameters would violate a precondition or if the method
  of your <code>Worm</code> class throws an exception (if so, wrap the
  exception in a <code>ModelException</code>). <b>ModelException should not be
  used anywhere outside of your Facade implementation.</b></li>
  
  <li>The rules described above and the documentation described below for each
  method apply only to the class implementing IFacade. Your class for
  representing worms should follow the rules described in the assignment.</li>
  
  <li>Do not modify the signatures of the methods defined in this interface.
  You can however add additional methods, as long as these additional methods
  do not overload the existing ones. Each additional method must be implemented
  in your class <code>Facade</code>.</li>
  
  <li>Your <code>Facade</code> class should offer a default constructor.</li>
  </ul>
