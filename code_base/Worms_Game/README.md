# Worms_Game
This program was made for the course of Object Oriented Programming with Java at KU Leuven, together with Bob Vanhoof.<br>
What kind of a game is this? I'll let Wikipedia do the honours:

Worms is a series of artillery strategy computer games developed by British company Team17. Players control a small platoon of worms across a deformable landscape, battling other computer- or player-controlled teams. The games feature bright and humorous cartoon-style animation and a varied arsenal of bizarre weapons.

The game is multi player, there's a possibility for AI worms as well. You can even implement your own AI program in a text file; the software will parse it and execute it.
The whole thing was made using Eclipse, and we always ran it within that environement, so I suggest you do that as well if you want to try it out.
